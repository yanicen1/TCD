# Application of the Theory of Critical Distances in the prediction of fatigue behavior of notched additive manufactured Ti-6Al-4V bodies with machined-and-polished and as-built surfaces
In this paper the Theory of Critical Distances (TCD) was used: a novel approach was developed to the analysis of stress/life fatigue data and applied to results from the published literature on laser sintered (LS) and electron beam melted (EBM) Ti-6Al-4V notched and plain specimens. Two approaches of the TCD, the point (PM) and line method (LM), were assessed. A detailed description of the project you can find in the file "Main_file.ipynb". More information about TCD is in the book "The Theory of Critical Distances" by David Taylor, 2007. All used libraries were saved in files 'requirements.txt' and 'environment.yaml' for conda.
