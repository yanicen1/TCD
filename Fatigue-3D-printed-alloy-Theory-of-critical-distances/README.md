# Fatigue investigation of a 3D printed alloy using the Theory of Critical Distances

The research is dedicated to the fatigue life study of a 3D printed alloy on specimens with stress raisers using the Theory of Critical Distances. A detailed description of the project you can find in the file "[Main_file.ipynb](https://github.com/yanicen1/Theory-of-Critical-Distances/blob/main/Fatigue-3D-printed-alloy-Theory-of-critical-distances/Main_file.ipynb)". More information about TCD is in the book "[The Theory of Critical Distances](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-08-044478-9.X5000-5)" by David Taylor, 2007. All used libraries were saved in files 'requirements.txt' and 'environment.yaml' for conda.
